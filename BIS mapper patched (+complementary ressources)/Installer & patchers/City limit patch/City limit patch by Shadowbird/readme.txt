Fallout 2 + Mapper remove City Limit patch
------------------------------------------

INTRO
-----

It's here. Those of you who do modding most probably know of the city limit that Fallout 2 has (49 areas, if you add any, the game crashes), as well as of the patch that fixed that. Unfortunately, the patch only fixed Fallout 2 game, and the Mapper would still crash if any cities were added.

Well, not anymore!

Using F49+ patch, you can patch not only the game, but also the editors! I have to admit I would never have made this patch without the original one, so I thank it's makers.


INSTALLATION & PATCHING
-----------------------

Just copy the f49.exe anywhere you want and run it. It'a self-executable archive, just choose the directory where you want it put and press "Install". It is recommended for yor own comfort that you put it in the directory where fallout2.exe/mapper2.exe is, but it is not necessary. Then run the patcher, set the paths to the .exe files, and press "Do it!". That's it!
